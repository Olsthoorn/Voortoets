(New) users or potential users of ground or surface waterr in Flanders need to announce their wanted changes to the water system to fhe Flanders Government. They do this through a website which that after filling in properties of their plans carries out some predictions of the potential impact that thouse plans have om the water system as a first step to estimate postential impacts on proctectd ecosystems. The predictions are computations done with a set of analytical solutions for essentially groundwater flow situations. The government of Flanders intends to check and improve their pretesting system. This current GIT project has preparational stuff to allow at least some of the seeked improvements.

AGT in Berchem, Flandes, was commissiond to carry out the project. The current GIT project is only some of the work to support AGT carried out by me.
